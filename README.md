# Twords

Twitter Word Frequency Analysis

Twords takes in a csv file of tweets (gathered using GetOldTweets here: https://github.com/Jefferson-Henrique/GetOldTweets-java), 
cleans them, removes stopwords, and visualizes the frequency of words (including frequencies relative to background word frequencies drawn from a sample of tweets from the Twitter API). 

It also lets you add your own stop words and query specific words or groups of words for their relative frequencies. 

Soon to be added: plug-in with Stanford NLP sentiment analyzer to return a sentiment score for each tweet.
