# Twords

Twitter Word Frequency Analysis

Twords takes in a csv file of tweets (gathered using GetOldTweets here: https://github.com/Jefferson-Henrique/GetOldTweets-java), 
cleans them, removes stopwords, and visualizes the frequency of words (including frequencies relative to background word frequencies 
drawn from a sample of tweets from the Twitter API).
